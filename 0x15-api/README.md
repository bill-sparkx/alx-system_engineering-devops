PI and RESTful APIs

An API, or Application Programming Interface, is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. It defines how different software components should interact and exchange data.

One popular type of API is a RESTful API. REST stands for Representational State Transfer, and it is an architectural style for designing networked applications. RESTful APIs are based on a set of principles that make them simple, scalable, and easy to use.

Here are some key characteristics of RESTful APIs:

- **Stateless**: Each request from a client to a server contains all the information needed to understand and process the request. The server does not store any information about the client's state between requests.

- **Resource-based**: RESTful APIs are built around resources, which are identified by unique URLs (Uniform Resource Locators). Clients can interact with these resources by sending HTTP requests to their corresponding URLs.

- **HTTP Verbs**: RESTful APIs use standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) to perform different operations on resources. For example, a GET request retrieves a resource, while a POST request creates a new resource.

- **Uniform Interface**: RESTful APIs have a uniform interface, meaning that the same set of HTTP methods and status codes are used consistently across different resources. This makes it easier for developers to understand and use the API.

- **Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State (HATEOAS)**: RESTful APIs can include hyperlinks in their responses, allowing clients to navigate and discover related resources dynamically.

By following these principles, RESTful APIs provide a flexible and scalable way to build web services that can be consumed by a wide range of clients, including web browsers, mobile apps, and other servers.

In this project, we will be working with RESTful APIs to perform various tasks, such as retrieving data, creating resources, and updating existing resources. Stay tuned for more details on how to interact with APIs in the upcoming sections.
